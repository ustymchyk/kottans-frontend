<h2>Impressions about learned materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It was interesting to work with HEAD. In practice, I haven`t worked with it before.</li>
  <li>Rebase:) I think it`s pretty the same as previous. I`ve heard about it but always use merging. It was a good practice.</li>
  <li>I`ll use a command-line for git operations to master my skills.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Linux CLI, and HTTP</h2>
<h3>Linux Survival</h3>
<ul>
  <li>grep, pipe</li>
  <li>power of combination with 'pipe'</li>
  <li>ofc. pipe</li>

  <li>40x40 - min size for mobile buttons, media attribute in in link tag</li>
  <li>mark up patterns has names too(column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, off canvas)</li>
  <li>I`ll check if all of the buttons have 40x40px min size on tap devices</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

<img src="task_js_basics/freecodecamp_basic.png" width="500px" alt="basic javascript: done">
<img src="task_js_basics/freecodecamp_basic_alg.png" width="500px" alt="basic algorithm scripting: done">
<img src="task_js_basics/freecodecamp_data.png" width="500px" alt="basic data structures: done">

<img src="task_js_basics/freecodecamp_int_alg.png" width="500px" alt="intermediate algorithm scripting: done">


<p>In general, this part for me was about 'done, done, done', but some points was surprising and interesting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I haven`t use destructuring in function parameters before. It`s really comfortable. I`ll definitely use it.</li>
  <li>One more think about destructuring - swiping values between variables. It`s surprised me.</li>
  <li>Function programming - I heard about it, but haven`t used it. It was good practice and knowledge.</li>
  <li>And, the funniest: I`ve always called function parameters as arguments. xD</li>
</ul>

<h2>DOM</h2>
<h3>JavaScript and the DOM</h3>
<img src="task_js_dom/udacity_dom.png" width="500px" alt="JavaScript and the DOM: done">
<p>Information about interfaces and inheritances was helpful. Now I understand, how to correctly find out methods and properties that I need on MDN.</p>
<p>The difference between textContent and innerText was surprising. </p>
<p>The performance part was especially interesting(createDocumentFragment was new for me)</p>

<h3>Freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges</h3>
<img src="task_js_dom/algorithm_int.png" width="500px" alt="Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: done">
<p>This part was certainly challenging. In this part, I received a lot of new information, like how to find common multiple, convert binary to string, generate primes, etc.</p>
<p>I think all of this information will be useful in the future.</p>


<h2>Object-Oriented JavaScript</h2>

</a>
<p>I`ve known about prototypes before, but a lot of information was new to me.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object.create() - i used to use 'obj.__proto__' to define prototype chain.</li>
  <li>'Function Classes' and 'Prototypal Classes' patterns were new for me and helped me to understand a lot..</li>
  <li>I`ve read about 'PseudoClassical Subclasses' before but never used it. It was good practice.</li>
</ul>
