## Git Basics

It was interesting to work with HEAD and Rebase. In practice, I haven't worked with it before.
In practice, I used to use 'vscode' git manager, but now I`m using the command line for all GIT operations to improve my skills.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

### Command line

A lot of operators were new to me, but some of them were really impressive and interesting.
For example, 'grep' with combinations of 'pipe' and '>>' are very powerful.

### Linux

The optional course 'Configuring Linux Web Servers' gave me a full picture from the top of how the web work.
Also, which Linux folders consist of what. And how Linux managing users, how to find commands etc.
Very useful part.

### HTTP

Requests types like HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS were new for me, like HTTP cache too.
Together with 'Configuring Linux Web Servers' it gave me a view from the top on it.

## Git Collaboration

### GitHub & Collaboration

All GitHub infrastructure was new for me. I knew about GitHub, a had some repo on it, but wasn't work with it in depth.
Also, I didn't know about setting up a few remote repositories, like origin and upstream. It is very useful while working with forks.

### Learn git branching

Command 'cherry-pick' was new for me.
Also, some hacks like 'git push origin :some-branch' for deleting a remote branch were new for me.
And pushing with pulling without checkout was new.
In general, this part expanded my knowledge of branching.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

This part wasn't new for me.
Just have refreshed my knowledge.

## Responsive Web Design

### Responsive Web Design Fundamentals

Some information was new for me, like min size for mobile buttons, media attribute in the link tag.
Also, I didn't know that mark up has named patterns(column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, off canvas).

### Flexbox Froggy

I've played this game before, but this time I've got new information too.
And it is a Wrap-reverse.
Last time I didn't understand how to make the last challenge.

## HTML & CSS practice

[Demo](https://ustymchyk.github.io/html-css-popup/)
[Codebase](https://github.com/ustymchyk/html-css-popup)

Besides the task, the gh-pages was new for me.

## JavaScript Basics

In general, this part for me was about 'done, done, done', but some points was surprising and interesting:

- I haven't use destructuring in function parameters before. It's really comfortable. I'll definitely use it.
- One more think about destructuring - swiping values between variables. It's surprised me.
- Function programming - I heard about it, but haven't used it. It was good practice and knowledge.
- And, the funniest: I've always called function parameters as arguments. xD

## Document Object Model

[Demo](https://ustymchyk.github.io/js-dom/) | [Code base](https://github.com/ustymchyk/js-dom/tree/master)

### JavaScript and the DOM

Information about interfaces and inheritances was helpful. Now I understand, how to correctly find out methods and properties that I need on MDN.
The difference between textContent and innerText was surprising.
The performance part was especially interesting(createDocumentFragment was new for me).

### Freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges

This part was certainly challenging. In this part, I received a lot of new information, like how to find common multiple, convert binary to string, generate primes, etc.
I think all of this information will be useful in the future.

## Building a Tiny JS World

## Object-Oriented JavaScript

[Demo](https://ustymchyk.github.io/frogger/) | [Code base](https://github.com/ustymchyk/frogger)

A lot of information about prototypes were new for me:

- `Object.create()` - i used to use `obj.__proto__` to define prototype chain.
- 'Function Classes' and 'Prototypal Classes' patterns were new for me and helped me to understand a lot..
- I`ve read about 'PseudoClassical Subclasses' before but never used it. It was good practice.

## OOP exercise

[Demo](https://ustymchyk.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/) | [Code base](https://github.com/ustymchyk/a-tiny-JS-world)

This part was full of new information for me.
Topic 'How to explain object-oriented programming concepts to a 6-year-old' is really helpful and gives clear understanding between OOP principles.
Also DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles was new.

## Memory Pair Game
