## Git Basics

It was interesting to work with HEAD and Rebase. In practice, I haven't worked with it before. Also, some hacks like 'git push origin :some-branch' for deleting a remote branch were new for me. In practice, I used to use 'vscode' git manager, but now I`m using the command line for all GIT operations to improve my skills.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

### Command line

A lot of operators were new to me, but some of them were really impressive and interesting.
For example, 'grep' with combinations of 'pipe' and '>>' are very powerful.

### Linux

The optional course 'Configuring Linux Web Servers' gave me a full picture from the top of how the web work.
Also, which Linux folders consist of what. And how Linux managing users, how to find commands etc.
Very useful part.

### HTTP

Requests types like HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS were new for me, like HTTP cache too.
Together with 'Configuring Linux Web Servers' it gave me a view from the top on it.

<h2>Git Collaboration</h2>
<h3>GitHub & Collaboration</h3>
<img src="task_git_collaboration/udacity.png" alt="udacity: done">
<ul>
  <li>Setting up two remote repo(origin and uppstream)</li>
  <li>Git commands has --grep too:)</li>
  <li>Rebase for squashing by CL. I`ve used for it GITLAB interface before.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>

<h3>Responsive Web Design Fundamentals</h3>
<img src="task_responsive_web_design/udacity.png" alt="Responsive Web Design Fundamentals: done">
<ul>
  <li>40x40 - min size for mobile buttons, media attribute in in link tag</li>
  <li>mark up patterns has names too(column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, off canvas)</li>
  <li>I`ll check if all of the buttons have 40x40px min size on tap devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flexbox Froggy</h3>
<img src="task_responsive_web_design/froggy.png" alt="Flexbox Froggy: done">
<p>Wrap-reverse - new thing that surprised me that I`m going to use :D</p>

<h2>HTML & CSS practice</h2>
<img src="task_html_css_popup/page.png" alt="HTML & CSS practice: done">
<ul>
  <li>How to make label focusable</li>
  <li>Github pages deployment from picked branch</li>
  <li>Github pages</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

<img src="task_js_basics/freecodecamp_int_alg.png" width="500px" alt="intermediate algorithm scripting: done">

<p>In general, this part for me was about 'done, done, done', but some points was surprising and interesting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I haven`t use destructuring in function parameters before. It`s really comfortable. I`ll definitely use it.</li>
  <li>One more think about destructuring - swiping values between variables. It`s surprised me.</li>
  <li>Function programming - I heard about it, but haven`t used it. It was good practice and knowledge.</li>
  <li>And, the funniest: I`ve always called function parameters as arguments. xD</li>
</ul>

<h2>DOM</h2>
<h3>JavaScript and the DOM</h3>
<img src="task_js_dom/udacity_dom.png" width="500px" alt="JavaScript and the DOM: done">
<p>Information about interfaces and inheritances was helpful. Now I understand, how to correctly find out methods and properties that I need on MDN.</p>
<p>The difference between textContent and innerText was surprising. </p>
<p>The performance part was especially interesting(createDocumentFragment was new for me)</p>
<p>DOM practice:</p>

<h3>Freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges</h3>
<img src="task_js_dom/algorithm_int.png" width="500px" alt="Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: done">
<p>This part was certainly challenging. In this part, I received a lot of new information, like how to find common multiple, convert binary to string, generate primes, etc.</p>
<p>I think all of this information will be useful in the future.</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented JavaScript</h2>

<p>I`ve known about prototypes before, but a lot of information was new to me.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object.create() - i used to use 'obj.__proto__' to define prototype chain.</li>
  <li>'Function Classes' and 'Prototypal Classes' patterns were new for me and helped me to understand a lot..</li>
  <li>I`ve read about 'PseudoClassical Subclasses' before but never used it. It was good practice.</li>
</ul> -->
