<h2>Impressions about learned materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It was interesting to work with HEAD. In practice, I haven`t worked with it before.</li>
  <li>Rebase:) I think it`s pretty the same as previous. I`ve heard about it but always use merging. It was a good practice.</li>
  <li>I`ll use a command-line for git operations to master my skills.</li>
</ul>
